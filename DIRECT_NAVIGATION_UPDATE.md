# Direct Pattern Navigation Update

## âœ… Feature Implementation Complete

I've successfully refactored the navigation to eliminate intermediate category pages, creating a direct path from the catalogue to pattern detail pages while maintaining the tab structure.

### Changes Made:

1. **Updated Categories API** (`/api/categories`)
   - Now includes `main_pattern_slug` for each category
   - Returns the first pattern's slug for direct navigation

2. **Modified CategoryCard Component**
   - Links directly to `/patterns/{category-slug}/{pattern-slug}`
   - Falls back to category page if no main pattern exists

3. **Created Main Pattern API** (`/api/categories/[slug]/main-pattern`)
   - Returns the first pattern for a given category
   - Used for redirects when accessing category URLs directly

4. **Updated Category Page**
   - Now acts as a redirect page
   - Automatically redirects to the main pattern
   - Shows loading skeleton during redirect

5. **Improved Pattern Detail Page**
   - "Back" button now returns to Pattern Catalogue
   - Better loading state that shows tab structure
   - Maintains the three-tab layout (Explanation, Examples, Templates)

### User Flow:

1. User visits `/patterns` (Pattern Catalogue)
2. User clicks on "Cookie Banners" category card
3. User is taken directly to `/patterns/cookie-banners/cookie-consent-banners`
4. Pattern page displays with three tabs, "Explanation" tab active by default
5. User can navigate back to catalogue with "Back to Pattern Catalogue" button

### Benefits:

- **Fewer clicks**: Direct access to pattern information
- **Cleaner navigation**: No unnecessary intermediate pages
- **Better UX**: Users get to content faster
- **Maintained structure**: URL structure still shows hierarchy
- **Backward compatible**: Old category URLs redirect automatically

### Technical Notes:

- Category pages (`/patterns/[category]`) now redirect to main pattern
- API efficiently fetches only the first pattern slug for performance
- Loading states maintain visual consistency during navigation
- Tab structure preserved as requested in the specification

The feature is now live and ready for testing!

# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

Since GitHub CLI is not installed, please follow these steps to create and connect your repository:

## Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Fill in the following details:
   - **Repository name**: `privacy-ui-patterns`
   - **Description**: `Privacy-UI design patterns for GDPR/CCPA compliance with real-world examples and academic foundations`
   - **Public/Private**: Select **Public** (for educational sharing)
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
3. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Connect Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Use these in your terminal:

```bash
cd "/Users/michaelavaliquette/Dev Projects/Test-thesis-ui"

# Add the remote repository (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/privacy-ui-patterns.git

# Verify the remote was added
git remote -v

# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

If you're using SSH instead of HTTPS:
```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/privacy-ui-patterns.git
```

## Step 3: Verify Everything Worked

1. Refresh your GitHub repository page
2. You should see all your files including:
   - README.md with the pattern library overview
   - UI_Libary_2025.html
   - privacy_ui_scraper/ folder
   - LICENSE file

## Cloning Instructions for Others

Once your repository is set up, others can clone it with:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/privacy-ui-patterns.git
cd privacy-ui-patterns
```

## Contributing Workflow

For contributors:

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone their fork locally
3. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/improvement`
4. Make changes and commit: `git commit -m "Add new privacy pattern"`
5. Push to their fork: `git push origin feature/improvement`
6. Create a Pull Request on GitHub

## Keeping Your Local Copy Updated

To sync with any changes:

```bash
git pull origin main
```

## Next Steps

1. Add collaborators: Go to Settings → Manage access → Add people
2. Set up Issues for tracking feature requests and bugs
3. Consider adding GitHub Pages to host the HTML pattern library
4. Add topics to your repository for better discoverability (e.g., "privacy", "ui-patterns", "gdpr", "ccpa")

## Alternative: Install GitHub CLI

If you'd prefer to use GitHub CLI for future operations:

```bash
# Install with Homebrew (macOS)
brew install gh

# Then authenticate
gh auth login
```

This will make future GitHub operations much easier!

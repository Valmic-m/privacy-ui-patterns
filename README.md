# Privacy-UI Pattern Library

A comprehensive collection of privacy-focused UI design patterns for GDPR and CCPA compliance, featuring real-world examples and academic foundations.

## Overview

This repository contains a curated library of 29 privacy UI design patterns that help designers and developers create user interfaces that respect user privacy while maintaining compliance with data protection regulations. Each pattern is documented with practical examples, implementation guidelines, and theoretical foundations.

## Privacy UI Patterns Included

5. **Cookie Banner** - GDPR-compliant cookie consent interfaces
6. **Terms Update Notice** - Notification patterns for policy changes

### Data Control Patterns
7. **Data Export** - User data portability interfaces
8. **Account Deletion** - Complete account removal workflows
9. **Data Minimization Form** - Collecting only necessary information
10. **Privacy Settings** - Granular privacy control interfaces
11. **Data Access Request** - User data access workflows
12. **Opt-out Mechanism** - Easy unsubscribe and opt-out patterns

### Transparency Patterns
13. **Privacy Label** - Visual privacy information displays
14. **Data Usage Indicator** - Real-time data usage notifications
15. **Third-party Sharing Notice** - Clear communication about data sharing
16. **Privacy-Friendly Defaults** - Opt-in by default patterns
17. **Audit Trail** - User activity and data access logs
18. **Purpose Specification** - Clear data collection purpose statements

### Security & Authentication Patterns
19. **Two-Factor Authentication** - Enhanced security login flows
20. **Privacy-Preserving Analytics** - Anonymous usage tracking
21. **Secure Data Entry** - Protected input field patterns
22. **Session Timeout** - Automatic logout for privacy protection
23. **Privacy Mode Toggle** - Temporary enhanced privacy states

### Communication Patterns
24. **Privacy-First Onboarding** - Privacy-focused user introduction
25. **Breach Notification** - Data breach communication templates
26. **Privacy Education** - In-app privacy literacy features
27. **Consent Receipt** - Proof of consent patterns
28. **Privacy Contact** - Easy access to privacy support
29. **Age Verification** - Child privacy protection patterns

## Privacy by Design Principles

This library is built on Cavoukian's 7 foundational principles of Privacy by Design:

1. **Proactive not Reactive** - Preventative not remedial
2. **Privacy as the Default** - Maximum privacy without user action
3. **Privacy Embedded into Design** - Integral part of the system
4. **Full Functionality** - Positive-sum, not zero-sum
5. **End-to-End Security** - Secure throughout lifecycle
6. **Visibility and Transparency** - Trust through verification
7. **Respect for User Privacy** - User interests paramount
